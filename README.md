born 1992. life-long coder. senior. architect.  
deep in monk mode. dedicated to the craft.  
warlock. alchemist.. no, actually.. "unhinged buildercore maniac".  

darkness for the silence. silence for the focus.  
build until i'm hungry. eat until i'm not.  
build until i'm tired. sleep until i'm not.  

blackout curtains. coffee at noon.  
did i build it right? or was it the right thing to build?  
failed again? skill issue. deadwood to burn.  

skipped breakfast. forgot lunch. no, i don't do "weekends".  
burnout, my old familiar, now kneels before me.  
it only hurts a little.  

just imagine sisyphus happy.
