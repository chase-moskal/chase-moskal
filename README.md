born 1992. life-long coder. senior engineer. architect. unhinged buildercore maniac.

deep in monk mode. life dedicated to the craft. care about nothing else. doing *nothing* else.

darkness for silence. silence for focus.

build until i'm hungry. eat until i'm not.

build until i'm tired. sleep until i'm not.

blackout curtains. wake at noon. coffee by one.

did i build it right? or was it the right thing to build?

failed again? skill issue. more deadwood to burn.

skipped breakfast. forgot lunch. i don't do "weekends".

burnout, my old familiar, now kneels before me.

just imagine sisyphus happy. this will only hurt a little.
