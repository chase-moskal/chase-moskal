born 1992. life-long coder. senior. architect.  
warlock energy. alchemy.  
actually, unhinged buildercore maniac.  

deep in monk mode. life dedicated to the craft.  
care about nothing else.  
doing *nothing* else.  

darkness for silence. silence for focus.  
build until i'm hungry. eat until i'm not.  
build until i'm tired. sleep until i'm not.  

blackout curtains. wake at noon. coffee at one.  
did i build it right? or was it the right thing to build?  
failed again? skill issue. deadwood to burn.  

skipped breakfast. forgot lunch. no, i don't do "weekends".  
burnout, my old familiar, now kneels before me.  
it only hurts a little.  

just imagine sisyphus happy.
